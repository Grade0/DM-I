## About the Dataset

[[Seismic Bumps Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/seismic-bumps)]

The data was taken by the polish "Institute of Computer Science, Silesian University of Technology" and the " Institute of Innovative Technologies", from a Polish coal mine.     
"Mining activity was and is always connected with the occurrence of dangers which are commonly called
mining hazards. A special case of such threat is a seismic hazard which frequently occurs in many
underground mines. Seismic hazard is the hardest detectable and predictable of natural hazards and in
this respect it is comparable to an earthquake. More and more advanced seismic and seismoacoustic
monitoring systems allow a better understanding rock mass processes and definition of seismic hazard
prediction methods." 
## About the project

In this project consists in analyzing with data mining tools the problem of forecasting high seismic bumps in a coal mine. The project is divided in four parts as follow: 

- Data Understanding & Preparation 
- Clustering
- Classification
- Pattern mining
